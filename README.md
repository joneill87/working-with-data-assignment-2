# Assignment 2

This is your repository for Assignment 2 of the Working with Data module. This repository is seeded with the files you need for part 1 of the assignment. When you are given part 2 of the assignment you can drop the files into this folder to add them to your repository.

## Background
You have been asked to assist a non-profit organisation in generating publicity through sponsoring a series of Ted talks. Your client would like to take a data-driven approach to deciding on how to best engineer the content for maximum impact. In the *data* folder you will find four files, giving statistics on Ted talks delivered over the past number of years.

## Your Aim
Your goal is to prepare a document advising your client on how best to ensure that their Ted talk(s) generate maximum impact. Your client has secured a number of slots, but the content and delivery of those talks is up to them. Prepare a python notebook which uses the data files provided to come up with a strategy. Include graphs where appropriate and make sure you explain your line of reasoning.
